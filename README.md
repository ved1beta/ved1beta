- **Machine Learning Specialist:** Proficient in statistical analysis, predictive modeling (Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), and advanced algorithms (CatBoost, SGD) with strong focus on optimization and accuracy.
## Key Projects 📚
- **[WED BOT](https://talktoved.streamlit.app):** A bot who mimics my personality and talks like me (fun fact: It has 2 personalities). None is like the real me
- **[Pdf_summariser](https://github.com/ved1beta/RAG_keyee):** Innovative RAG web app for PDF analysis using machine learning. Enables intelligent document summarization and information retrieval through advanced embedding and tokenization techniques. Transforms PDF content into actionable insights with AI-powered processing.
- **[LLM tokenizer](http://13.202.119.44:8000/):**  Bulding a tokenizer for llm from scratch :)
- **[Loan approval predictor](http://13.202.119.44:4000/):** Utilized a huge dataset of loan defaults and performed data transformation and model training. Tried different methods to get 95%+ accuracy and deployed with AWS and implemented CI/CD pipelines
- **[Image classification Model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/V-E-D/MINST):** Trained a neural network from scratch in pure Python (no libraries) and achieved 80%+ accuracy on the MNIST dataset
- **[v0 clone](https://github.com/ved1beta/v.o_clone):** made backend of v0 that for given prompt gives back code for website it writes in react and node mainly but you can choose any framework please check out ,

- **[Research-copilot](https://github.com/ved1beta/research-copilot):** working on a chat bot that will help in research and provide relavent links citations and summarization of given paper made with RAG and llama models used vector DB storage nad a=Advanced Rag models 
- **[Msx_gen](https://github.com/ved1beta/msx_gen):** Bot that takes in a video extracts its mood and vibe and generated music based on the video just a curious project learned about music theory and vidoe processing from OpenCV and deploying on AWS 
# Working on 
Many in deployment many failed T_T"

- **[Transformer](https://github.com/ved1beta/Transformer):** writing transformer from scratch : ) 

- **[Freelance work here and there]():**
## Leadership & Advocacy 🌟
- **FreecodeCamp:** Wrorked as Teaching Assistance Utilized advanced teaching methods to facilitate hands-on coding projects, resulting in a 30% increase in student engagement and participation levels.
