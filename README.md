👋 Hi, I'm Ved! I’m🎖️ a Machine Learning engineer focused on harnessing technology to make significant impacts in the tech industry and beyond.


## About Me
🚀 Young and ambitious developer on a mission to create impact through innovative AI solutions! Currently pursuing Minor in AI from IIT Ropar while diving deep into self-learning adventures.

💡 Passionate about Machine Learning with special love for Computer Vision and NLP - always excited to tackle challenging problems where AI meets real-world impact.

🔮 Whether it's teaching machines to see, understand language, or solve complex problems, I'm your go-to person for turning AI dreams into reality! Let's build something amazing together!

## Technical Skills 🛠️
- **Languages:** Python, C , javascript 
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Fast ai , Pytorch , Pandas , Matplotlib
- **Tools & Platforms:** GitHub, Docker, , Vercel, Neovim , Vscode , JupyterNoterbook , Aws
- **Machine Learning Specialist:** Proficient in statistical analysis, predictive modeling (Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest), and advanced algorithms (CatBoost, SGD) with strong focus on optimization and accuracy.
## Key Projects 📚
- **[WED BOT](https://talktoved.streamlit.app):** A bot who mimics my personality and talks like me (fun fact: It has 2 personalities). None is like the real me 
- **[Loan approval predictor](https://github.com/ved1beta/LOAN_model/):** Utilized a huge dataset of loan defaults and performed data transformation and model training. Tried different methods to get 95%+ accuracy and deployed with AWS and implemented CI/CD pipelines
- **[Image classification Model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/V-E-D/MINST):** Trained a neural network from scratch in pure Python (no libraries) and achieved 80%+ accuracy on the MNIST dataset

Many in deployment many failed T_T"

## Leadership & Advocacy 🌟
- **FreecodeCamp:** Wrorked as Teaching Assistance Utilized advanced teaching methods to facilitate hands-on coding projects, resulting in a 30% increase in student engagement and participation levels.
